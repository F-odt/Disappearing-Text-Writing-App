Do everything in love.
Rejoice always.
I can do all this through him who gives me strength.
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
Do to others as you would have them do to you.
Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord.
Give thanks always.
Show me your ways, Lord, teach me your paths.
Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.
Rejoice in the Lord always I will say it again Rejoice.
Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever.
Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.
We love because he first loved us.
Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.
For nothing will be impossible for God.
Grace be with you all.
Everything should be done in love.
Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
